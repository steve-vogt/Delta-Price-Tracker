## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is it safe?</strong></summary>

Yes. The app runs 100% on your computer. No data is sent anywhere except to Delta.com (for price checks) and your email server (for alerts).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is there an 8 flight limit?</strong></summary>

To avoid being detected as a bot by Delta, we limit how many flights you can track. Each flight is checked ~20 minutes apart, so 8 flights takes about 2.5 hours to check. You can archive completed trips to make room for new ones.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work when my computer is off?</strong></summary>

No. Your computer needs to be on and connected to the internet. The app can run minimized in your system tray.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I need a Google App Password?</strong></summary>

For security. App Passwords are separate from your main password and can be revoked anytime at [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
